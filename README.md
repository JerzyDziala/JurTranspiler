# JurTranspiler

Jur is a statically typed, high level programming language transpiled down to Javascript.

Its main features are:

    structural typing (implemented)
    multiple inheritance (implemented)
    first class functions (implemented)
    generic programming (implemented)
    interop with existing javascript code (implemented)
    function overloading (implemented)
    runtime polymorphism in the form of multimethods (work in progress)
    runtime reflections (work in progress)

Semantic analysis is pretty much done and I just started programming the code generation phase so it is not usable right now (but you can still run/test the parsing and analysis phases)
